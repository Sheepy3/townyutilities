# Towny Utilities
This plugin implements utility commands for [Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny). These commands were developed specifically for use with [TownyAI](https://github.com/Sheepy3/townyai), but are packaged separately in case they may be useful for towny servers not running TownyAI. 


## Commands

### Force Claim
```/townyadmin claim [townname] [x] [z] [-w]```
if you add -w at the end the coordinates are interpreted as world coordinates. Otherwise, they are interpreted as chunk coordinates.

### purgeTowns
```/townyadmin purgetowns```
this command deletes every town on your server. Use at your own risk, there is no confirmation.
